<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</i>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time timedate="2016-11-30">November 30.</time></p>
